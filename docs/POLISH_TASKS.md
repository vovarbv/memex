# Memex Polish Tasks

> **Status**: Active - December 2024  
> **Purpose**: Remaining code quality improvements for production readiness  
> **Note**: Major architectural issues have been resolved (see `ARCHITECTURE_STATUS.md`)

## Remaining Polish Items

### 1. Code Documentation
**Priority**: Medium  
**Files**: All Python modules in `scripts/` and `ui/`

- [ ] Add consistent docstrings (Google style) to public functions and classes
- [ ] Complete type hints for function signatures
- [ ] Document complex algorithms and business logic

### 2. Logging Standardization
**Priority**: Medium  
**Files**: Backend scripts in `scripts/`

- [ ] Replace remaining `print()` statements with `logging` module
- [ ] Ensure consistent log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- [ ] Configure logging format and output destinations

### 3. Configuration Review
**Priority**: Low  
**Files**: `memory.toml`, `bootstrap_memory.py`

- [ ] Review default exclude patterns for completeness
- [ ] Verify all configuration options are documented
- [ ] Test bootstrap process in various project structures

### 4. Code Style Consistency
**Priority**: Low  
**Files**: Various

- [ ] Ensure consistent error message formatting
- [ ] Standardize function naming conventions
- [ ] Remove any remaining debugging comments

## Completed Major Work ✅

- ✅ **Security**: eval() vulnerability fixed with safe_eval.py
- ✅ **Thread Safety**: thread_safe_store.py implemented  
- ✅ **Memory Management**: memory_bounded_index_manager.py added
- ✅ **Test Suite**: 158/158 tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ **Import System**: Package structure standardized
- ✅ **Path Handling**: Centralized through memory_utils.ROOT
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling implemented
- ✅ **Task ID Management**: TaskStore handles ID generation properly
- ✅ **Memory Tab Issues**: Display and search functionality fixed

## Notes

- **No Critical Issues Remain**: All security, stability, and functionality problems resolved
- **Production Ready**: Core system is stable and tested
- **Polish Only**: Remaining tasks are code quality improvements, not fixes
- **Optional Timeline**: These can be addressed incrementally as needed
