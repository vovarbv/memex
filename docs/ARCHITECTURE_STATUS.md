# Memex Architecture Status

## Overview
This document tracks the current architectural status of Memex, consolidating information about completed improvements and remaining work.

## Completed Improvements âœ…

### 1. Security Fixes
- **eval() Vulnerability** (CRITICAL - FIXED)
  - Replaced dangerous `eval()` in search_tab.py with safe_eval.py module
  - Implemented comprehensive safe expression evaluator
  - Added expression validation UI
  - Full test coverage for allowed/blocked operations

### 2. Concurrency & Thread Safety
- **Race Conditions** (CRITICAL - FIXED)
  - Created thread_safe_store.py with thread-safe wrappers
  - Implemented both thread locks and file locks
  - Added atomic file operations for metadata
  - Comprehensive test suite for concurrent operations

### 3. Memory Management
- **Memory Leaks in IndexManager** (CRITICAL - FIXED)
  - Created memory_bounded_index_manager.py
  - Implemented automatic cache eviction (500MB limit, 1hr TTL)
  - Added LRU eviction strategy
  - Memory monitoring with psutil
  - Background cleanup thread

### 4. Test Suite
- **Test Coverage** (HIGH - FIXED)
  - Achieved 100% pass rate for active tests (158/158)
  - Fixed all import and API evolution issues
  - Implemented missing functionality (complete_step_logic)
  - Resolved test isolation problems
  - Added proper test infrastructure

### 5. Import System
- **Package Structure** (MEDIUM - FIXED)
  - Standardized imports across the codebase
  - Fixed test imports with proper package structure
  - Eliminated sys.path manipulations in tests

## Partially Addressed ðŸ”§

### 1. ID Management
- **Current State**: Still using sequential integer IDs for tasks
- **Improvement**: Better error handling for duplicates (DuplicateTaskIDError)
- **TODO**: Consider UUID-based system for distributed environments

### 2. Error Handling
- **Current State**: Improved with try/except blocks in critical paths
- **Improvement**: Better user-facing error messages in UI
- **TODO**: Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms

### 3. Documentation
- **Current State**: Core documentation exists and is mostly accurate
- **Improvement**: Added test documentation and architecture notes
- **TODO**: API documentation, type hints completion

## Remaining Work ðŸ“‹

### High Priority
1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Parallel file processing for indexing
   - Batch vector operations
   - Efficient pagination for large result sets

2. **Path Validation**
   - Strengthen path traversal prevention
   - Sandbox file access operations

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Reduce hardcoded values
   - Make more parameters configurable

### Medium Priority
1. **UI State Management**
   - Implement centralized state management
   - Improve cross-tab synchronization

2. **Code Quality**
   - Complete type hints across codebase
   - Reduce code duplication in UI tabs

3. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Add metrics collection
   - Performance monitoring
   - Health check endpoints

### Low Priority
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Backup/restore functionality
   - Migration tools for schema changes
   - Analytics dashboard

2. **Code Style**
   - Consistent docstring format
   - Architecture diagrams

## Architecture Principles

### Established Patterns
1. **Thread Safety**: All vector store operations go through thread_safe_store.py
2. **Memory Management**: FAISS indices cached with bounds via MemoryBoundedIndexManager
3. **Security**: User expressions evaluated only through safe_eval.py
4. **Path Resolution**: Centralized through memory_utils.ROOT and helper functions
5. **Task Management**: Single source of truth in TaskStore

### Design Guidelines
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation over hard failures
3. **User Experience**: Clear error messages, progress indicators
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for critical paths
5. **Configuration**: Behavior controllable via memory.toml

## Next Steps

### Current Focus
See `POLISH_TASKS.md` for remaining code quality improvements:
- Documentation and type hints
- Logging standardization  
- Configuration review
- Code style consistency

### Future Enhancements
See `FUTURE_VISION.md` for aspirational features:
- Intelligent context generation
- Auto-capture workflows
- Advanced analytics
- IDE integrations
